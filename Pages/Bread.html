        <p>
            Butter, flour, soy wax, oil, linen, clear acrylic, sound, brass bowl.
        </p>
        <p>
            What spaces ignite our shared humanity? Who pays the price for our collective appetites?
        </p>
        <p>
            Breaking Bread unfolds as both installation and performance, an invocation of 
            communal rituals, fragmented selves, and the cycles of consumption and decay. 
            At its core, the work reimagines the table as an altar, a space where bodies 
            gather in both communion and disintegration. The installation recalls the 1977 
            Bread Riots in Egypt, when the sudden removal of state subsidies exposed the 
            precarity of survival, turning bread from a daily staple into a contested symbol 
            of power. In a moment of rupture, food was no longer just sustenance—it became 
            leverage, withheld and granted at will. To consume is to participate in an economy 
            of control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cast bread sculptures of hardened butter dissolve under touch, leaving behind a 
            residue of excess and erosion. Overhead, a series of butter knives form a fragile 
            threshold, one that is dismantled with each blade taken, carving into the remains. 
            With every gesture, the space shifts between ritual and rupture, the collective and 
            the solitary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Activated through a performance by Assi Abogado, the work lingers in the tension 
            between indulgence and restraint, inheritance and disavowal. Over 20 minutes, the 
            performance escalates in aggression as it delves into the themes of vanity and 
            consumption, set against a meticulously deliberate pace. It is an offering and a 
            reckoning, a meditation on what is taken, what is left behind, and what ultimately 
            remains.

				<p>Marwan Ali is an Egyptian architect based in Dubai and a graduate of the 
                    American University of Sharjah. His work explores speculative cartographies, 
                    narrative reconstruction, and the shifting relationship between land, memory, 
                    and displacement. Engaging with mapping as an act of interpretation rather than 
                    definition, he examines how histories slip through fixed boundaries and how gaps 
                    in the archive might be reimagined.
				</p>
                <p>
                    Marwan’s approach blends tradition with contemporary methodologies, drawing from 
                    the region’s architectural heritage while interrogating its transformations. He 
                    was awarded special mention at the Architizer Vision Awards 2023 and won the Christo 
                    and Jeanne-Claude Award in 2020. He has collaborated on projects across the Middle 
                    East, engaging space as both a physical and narrative construct, shaping architecture 
                    as a site of negotiation between presence and absence.

        <div class="credit"><h2>Nour Elbery</h2>
			<div class="creditPara">
				<img class="creditImgLeft" src="../images/Nour.jpg">
				<p>Nour Elbery is an Egyptian artist, architect, and curator currently based 
                    in Dubai. She holds a Bachelor of Architecture from the American University 
                    of Sharjah (B.Arch 2022). Her work examines spatial conditions that anticipate 
                    and regulate the body, exploring how architectures dictate movement, enforce 
                    thresholds, and generate moments of misalignment. Spanning installation and 
                    sculpture, she interrogates the mechanics of spatial control—surfaces that 
                    instruct, structures that persist even in dysfunction—while exposing the 
                    fractures within these environments, revealing moments of hesitation, misregistration, 
                    and resistance.

                <p>
                    Her work has been exhibited at Jameel Arts Center for the installation 
                    <i>Breaking Bread,</i> commissioned as part of the Youth Takeover Program 2024. 
                    She was part of the winning trio to receive The Christo and Jeanne-Claude Award 
                    (2021) for the installation <i>Cocoon</i>.
