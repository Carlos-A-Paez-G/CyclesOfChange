        <h1 class="center">Eden: Decay and Bloom</h1>
        
        <p>As our lives become increasingly disconnected from nature, drawn toward technology and artificial 
            spaces, <i>Eden: Decay and Bloom</i> seeks to restore this connection through live sound and text in 
            an open setting. Featuring French compositions inspired by the landscapes of the Arab world, the 
            program reflects a shared human relationship with nature that transcends borders and cultures. At 
            times dissonant and unpredictable, the music serves as a reminder that nature is not only a source 
            of harmony and grounding but also a powerful, untamed force.
        </p>
        <p>
            Presented in an outdoor space, <i>Eden</i> highlights the irreplaceable energy of live performance as 
            music, nature, and human presence converge in real time. <i>Eden</i> reminds us of the harmonious 
            relationship between sound and nature as well as the unpredictability of that partnership. 
            It is a meditation on cycles - of growth and erosion, harmony and dissonance - reminding us 
            that Eden can be both a sanctuary and an exile. Just as the Eden of scripture offered shelter 
            before casting humanity into the unknown, this <i>Eden</i> invites the opportunity to reflect on nature’s 
            dual role: a place of refuge and reckoning.
