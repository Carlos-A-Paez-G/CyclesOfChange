        <h1 class="center">All These Faces Are Mine</h1>
        <p>All These Faces Are Mine explores the skins we wear and the changes they wreak on us, 
            while also celebrating multifaceted and complex identity. Different faces may allow us to 
            become different people, but who is to say they are only masks? </p>

                <p>Gillian Rhodes is an American artist working at the intersection of movement, performance, 
                    and storytelling. Classically trained from childhood in ballet, Gillian spent her teenage 
                    years learning circus and aerial silks, then majored in dance at Columbia University. Since 
                    graduating with honors in 2012, Gillian has performed in 20+ cities in 9 countries worldwide, 
                    working as an actor, model, dancer, choreographer, creative director, teacher, and much more. 
                    Gillian's diverse and varied experiences allow her to develop unique and universal stories that 
                    everyone can relate to. She has created her own method for understanding movement and meaning, 
                    Storytelling in Motion, which she has taught in numerous different settings. Based now in Dubai, 
                    she writes both fiction and non-fiction and speaks five languages. </p>

                <p><i>I work wherever movement, performance, and storytelling interact. I'm interested in 
                    exploring the transmission from storyteller to listener, the physicality of emotion and being, 
                    and the multiplicity of identity. Centered in my training in dance and built on my love for 
                    theatre, storytelling is the DNA of my body of work. </i></p>
