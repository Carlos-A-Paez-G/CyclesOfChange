        <p>
            Grow is a multidisciplinary performance that weaves together dance, storytelling, 
            live music, and video art to explore the themes of transformation, resilience, 
            and human connection. Presented at Al Bayt Mamzar on April 12 & 13, 2025 the piece 
            is an immersive journey through personal and collective narratives of growth, courage, 
            and self-discovery.
        </p>

        <p>
            The performance unfolds in a series of interconnected scenes, each shaped by personal 
            stories from the performers. Through dynamic choreography, evocative spoken word, synchronized 
            projections and a powerful singer, Grow creates a layered dialogue between movement and memory, 
            the individual and the collective.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grow invites audiences into a space of reflection and shared experience, highlighting the 
            beauty of change and the strength found in vulnerability.

                    Rawad is an Abu Dhabi based writer and poet. In 2013, he wandered into a 
                    Poeticians open mic in Dubai and saw the seeds of the creative community 
                    being sewn. Fast forward to 2017, he enters Backyard Poetry, Rooftop Rhythms, 
                    Blank Canvas, and the Abu Dhabi Writers Cafe, a community space he now co-hosts. 
                    It is from recognizing the reciprocal nurturing that creativity and community 
                    have for each other that he was able to re-define his relationship with 
                    Abu Dhabi, the city he has called home for over twenty years, and found the 
                    roots of his writing voice, emerging in creative nonfiction and prose poetry, 
                    among other branches of narrative. In 2023, he participated in NYUAD’s Hekayah | The Story 
                    and earlier this year he joined a cohort of poets at the Emirates Airlines Festival of 
                    Literature. His performances have been described as warm, almost conversational 
                    in tone. His writing touches on opulent themes of belonging, identity, uncertainty, 
                    of being tenuous and tethered at the same time, on time, and it’s bold unfolding. 
                    His most recent cross-disciplinary collarations were presented through the Dubai-based 
                    Mia Art Collection exhibition, La Belleza, and through The People's Project-- a 
                    movement-based  storytelling performance, supported by Emirates School of Dance and 
                    Cultural Foundation Abu Dhabi.
