        <h1 class="center">Of One Heart</h1>
		<p>This dance piece explores the enduring
			connection between two souls—whether siblings or
			strangers—bound by an invisible thread that neither
			time nor distance can sever. Performed on a stage
			hoop, the dancers are connected by a cord
			symbolizing the umbilical connection. As one tries to
			escape, the other pulls closer, embodying the ebb and
			flow of relationships. The cord becomes a lifeline, a
			reminder that no matter how far they run or change,
			the connection remains—sometimes strained,
			sometimes distant, but never broken.
