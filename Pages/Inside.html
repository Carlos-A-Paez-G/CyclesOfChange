        <h1 class="center">INSIDE</h1>
        <p> <i>INSIDE</i> is an on-going work-in-progress that studies performative embodied geometries. 
            The performance experiments with the relationship between moving bodies and a tailored 
            seven-meter diameter fabric spatial apparatus. When activated by the body, 
            the fabric apparatus transforms two and three dimensionally redefining the space of performance 
            and creating a co-dependence with the performers. The soundscape, also generated by the 
            body in different states of action and stasis, layers recorded and live sounds during 
            the performance and uses the natural biological cyclical rhythm of breath as co-performer. 
            The experience sets up a tension between audience, performer, and environment, that blurs the 
            space of performance. <i>INSIDE</i> is a speculative work that questions what constitutes 
            being inside – or outside – the space of performance.</p>
