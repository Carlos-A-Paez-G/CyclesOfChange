		<p>The work reflects the studio as a performative space, where surfaces function as a language, 
			absorbing energy and sound over time. Through digging, layering, and listening to the ambient 
			sound of audiobooks, it embeds performance within the artistic process, reflecting on the 
			solitude of labour and ongoing negotiation within the space.

			<div class="creditPara">

				<p>Amna Ilyas is a multidisciplinary artist and art educator. 
					She holds an MA in Fine Art from the UCA (OCA), London. 
					She has exhibited solo projects both at national and 
					international venues, including Bayt Al Mamzar, Dubai (2023), 
					Aicon Gallery in London (2011), and Seven Art (now known as Nature Morte) 
					in New Delhi, India (2010). She has been awarded several fellowships for 
					residencies and research programs globally, notable institutions such as 
					the Vermont Studios Center in the USA, Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop in 
					Scotland, Northlands Creative Glass Sculpture in the UK (2012), Kempinski 
					Art Program in Slovakia, Austria, Berlin and The Hungarian Multicultural
					Center in Budapest (2019).</p>

				<p>Her process-based practice explores the intersections of memory, 
					materiality, and reconstruction. Informed by archaeological methods and 
					conservation techniques, her approach is both gestural and investigative—where 
					excavation and reconstruction extend a relationship between various surfaces 
					and sound, discovering that they can not be separated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thinking of the studio as a performative space, she engages with the studio 
					as both a subject and a site of process where she treats surfaces as a language 
					that can be seductive, transparent, or opaque. These surfaces function as 
					institutions, absorbing layers of energy, dialogue, and presence over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The processes of digging, layering, and listening shaped by the ambient 
					sound of Audiobooks create an echoing dialogue to rephrase through gestures. 
					This recursive approach reverberates Bruce Nauman’s assertion that “if I am an 
					artist and I am in the studio, then whatever I am doing in the studio must be art.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Through repetition, appropriation, sound, and the presence of her own body, she embeds 
					performance into the artistic process, reflecting on the solitude of labour within a 
					space—an ongoing negotiation she constructs for herself.
