		<div class="credit"><h2>Dalia Yacine</h2>
			<div class="creditPara"><p>Dalia Yassine is a Lebanese film and performance maker currently based in Dubai. 
				Her interdisciplinary practice investigates hybrid arenas between cinematic, immersive and live 
				experiences through the crossover of lens-based work, contemporary performance, visual and
				 installation art.</p>
				<p>She holds a Postgraduate Degree in Filmmaking from The London Film Academy and an MA in Performance 
					Design from Central Saint Martins. Her works have been supported by AFAC, Cinephilia Productions,
					 MED Film Festival, EVA London and have been showcased in London, Beirut, Italy and Greece.</p>
				<p>Blending experimental techniques with narrative-driven content, her work is rooted 
				in representing human variation and fragility while delving into the complexities of identity, 
				transformation, memory and trans-corporeality. Looking at the body as ritual, living sculpture and a 
				landscape of our narrative subconscious, Dalia’s practice becomes a playground for the visual, verbal 
				and the visceral where movement across bodies, nature and environments alter our sense of self.</p> 
				<p>From live bodily presence to intimate screen-based aesthetics, her projects are intended to transport
				 her audience into an all-encompassing setting while transcending into the surreal, the haunting and 
				 the uncanny. </p>
