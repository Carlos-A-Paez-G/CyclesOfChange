        <p>
			Bringing together artists, performers, writers and designers, this initiative sets the 
			agendas that drive contemporary performance practice in the UAE.
		</p>
		<p>
			With Performance in Practice we ask: What is the socio-political context for contemporary 
			performance? What is its purpose? Who is it for? What might it be?
		</p>
		<p>
			Rooted in experimentation and often informed by current social, political, and cultural 
			contexts, we aim to challenge traditional notions of performance culture and audience engagement. 
			Rather than adhering to fixed genres or formats, it is about embracing hybridity, 
			interdisciplinarity, and innovation by interrogating the relationship(s) between media, 
			time-based practice, dance, theatre, music and visual art.
		</p>
		<p>
			The artists involved explore new modes of storytelling, embodiment, and space, 
			creating work that is dynamic, immersive, participatory, and thought-provoking.
			At its core, this platform invites us to question norms and experience art in transformative 
			and boundary-pushing ways.

				<p>Dalia Yassine is a Lebanese film and performance maker currently based in Dubai. 
				Her interdisciplinary practice investigates hybrid arenas between cinematic, immersive and live 
				experiences through the crossover of lens-based work, contemporary performance, visual and
				 installation art.</p>
				<p>She holds a Postgraduate Degree in Filmmaking from The London Film Academy and an MA in Performance 
					Design and Practice from Central Saint Martins. Her works have been supported by AFAC, Cinephilia Productions,
					 MED Film Festival, EVA London and have been showcased in London, Beirut, Italy and Greece.</p>
				<p>Blending experimental techniques with narrative-driven content, her work is rooted 
				in representing human variation and fragility while delving into the complexities of identity, 
				transformation, memory and trans-corporeality. Looking at the body as ritual, living sculpture and a 
				landscape of our narrative subconscious, Dalia’s practice becomes a playground for the visual, verbal 
				and the visceral where movement across bodies, nature and environments alter our sense of self.</p> 
				<p>From live bodily presence to intimate screen-based aesthetics, her projects are intended to transport
				 her audience into an all-encompassing setting while transcending into the surreal, the haunting and 
				 the uncanny. </p>
